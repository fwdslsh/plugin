# Orchestrator - Long-Running Agent Harness

A Bun/TypeScript implementation that orchestrates continuous coding agent sessions using the **Claude Agent SDK** for maximum visibility into Claude's execution.

## Features

- **Full Visibility**: Uses the Claude Agent SDK directly to stream all messages, tool uses, and results
- **Automatic Feature Progression**: Works through features in priority order
- **Session Management**: Configurable session limits, failure thresholds, and delays
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors feature completion and provides detailed statistics
- **Rich Output**: Shows system messages, assistant responses, tool executions, and results

## Installation

First, install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Make sure you have the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable set:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run the orchestrator with default settings (10 sessions max):

```bash
bun run cli.ts
```

Or use the npm script:

```bash
npm run cli
```

### Common Options

**Run until all features pass:**

```bash
bun run cli.ts --until-complete
# or
npm run cli:complete
```

**Run a specific number of sessions:**

```bash
bun run cli.ts --max-sessions 20
```

**Adjust failure tolerance:**

```bash
bun run cli.ts --max-failures 5
```

**Preview without executing:**

```bash
bun run cli.ts --dry-run --max-sessions 5
```

### All Options

```
--project-dir, -d DIR    Project directory (default: current directory)
--max-sessions, -n N     Maximum number of sessions to run (default: 10)
--max-failures, -f N     Stop after N consecutive failures (default: 3)
--delay SECONDS          Seconds to wait between sessions (default: 5)
--until-complete         Run until all features pass (implies unlimited sessions)
--dry-run                Show what would be done without executing
--help, -h               Show this help message
```

## How It Works

### Workflow

1. **Orient**: Reads project state from `feature_list.json` and `claude-progress.txt`
2. **Select Feature**: Chooses the next failing feature by priority (critical → high → medium → low)
3. **Execute**: Invokes Claude Agent SDK with the coding agent prompt
4. **Stream Output**: Shows all system messages, tool uses, and results in real-time
5. **Verify**: Checks if the feature was marked as passing in `feature_list.json`
6. **Repeat**: Continues to next feature or stops based on conditions

### Stopping Conditions

The orchestrator stops when:

- All features are passing (success!)
- Maximum sessions reached
- Maximum consecutive failures reached
- User interrupts (Ctrl+C)

### Output Examples

**System Initialization:**

```
📋 Session initialized:
  - Model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
  - CWD: /path/to/project
  - Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, ...
  - Permission mode: acceptEdits
```

**Tool Execution:**

```
🔧 Tool: Read
   Input: {
     "file_path": "/path/to/file.ts",
     "offset": 1,
     "limit": 50
   }

✅ Tool result: [file contents...]
```

**Session Result:**

```
🎯 Session Result
============================================================
Status: success
Turns: 12
Duration: 45.32s
API Time: 38.21s
Cost: $0.0234
Tokens: 15234 in / 2891 out
Cache: 12890 read / 0 created

Result: Feature AUTH-001 implemented successfully
============================================================
```

## Claude Agent SDK Benefits

By using the Claude Agent SDK instead of just the Anthropic API, we get:

1. **Full Tool Visibility**: See every tool call Claude makes with inputs and outputs
2. **Session Management**: Automatic conversation history and context management
3. **Permission Control**: Fine-grained control over file edits and command execution
4. **Cost Tracking**: Built-in usage and cost reporting per session
5. **Project Context**: Automatic loading of `CLAUDE.md` and project settings
6. **Better Debugging**: Clear visibility into why Claude makes each decision

## Integration with Feature List

The orchestrator expects a `feature_list.json` file in the project directory with this structure:

```json
{
	"features": [
		{
			"id": "AUTH-001",
			"description": "Implement user authentication",
			"priority": "critical",
			"passes": false
		},
		{
			"id": "UI-002",
			"description": "Add dark mode toggle",
			"priority": "medium",
			"passes": true
		}
	],
	"metadata": {
		"lastUpdated": "2025-11-28T10:30:00Z"
	}
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Agent SDK not found:**

```bash
bun install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
```

**API key not set:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Permission errors:**
The orchestrator uses `permissionMode: 'acceptEdits'` to auto-accept file edits. Adjust in the code if you need different behavior.

**No features progressing:**
Check that:

1. The coding agent prompt is appropriate for your project
2. Features are clearly defined in `feature_list.json`
3. The project environment is properly initialized (see `init.sh`)

## Comparison to Python Version

| Feature       | Python Version           | TypeScript (Bun) Version     |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Runtime       | Python 3                 | Bun                          |
| API           | Subprocess to Claude CLI | Claude Agent SDK             |
| Visibility    | Command output only      | Full message streaming       |
| Tool Tracking | None                     | Complete with inputs/outputs |
| Cost Tracking | None                     | Built-in per session         |
| Performance   | Subprocess overhead      | Direct SDK calls             |
| Debugging     | Limited                  | Rich event stream            |

## Development

To modify the orchestrator behavior, edit key sections:

- **Prompt Construction**: `buildCodingPrompt()` method
- **Feature Selection**: `getNextFeature()` method
- **Success Criteria**: Check in `runCodingSession()` after execution
- **Output Formatting**: Message handling in the `for await` loop
